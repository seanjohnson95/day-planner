# About
This website was developed so that you can manage your time more effectively.

When you open the planner,
the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
When you scroll down,
You will be presented with time blocks used in standard business hours.
When you view the time blocks for that day,
Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
When you click into a time block,
You can enter your event.
When you click the save button for that time block,
the text for that event is saved in local storage.
When you refresh the page,
the saved events persist.
